Sensor board:
    0. Add version to silkscreen
    1. X1 and C1/C2 are too close
    2. X1 keepout/silkscreen too small
    3. Investigate smaller C1/C2
    4. P1/P2 holes too small
    5. J1 mounting holes a little too close
    6. U2 holes could be closer to match T-92
    7. P1 and C3 are too close
    8. rotate U2 180deg
    9. Add a 4.7k pullup on the 1-wire line [done]
    10. Add a pad for reset so that it's easy to so ICSP [done]
    11. Change sonar to 5v


RaspverryPi Interface:
    0. Add version to silkscreen
    1. Consider notching out so the board can sit lower (no need for extended height 36pin headers)
    2. 1-wire chip isn't supported
    3. 3.3v regulator pinout isn't right for the LTC1117 (silkscreen and pin 1 are revesed
    4. 5v regulator isn't right for the traco module
    5. Rotate/move the 5v connector so that it lines up with the RPIs ethernet connector
    6. Maybe just used the UBEC, and assume 5v input?
